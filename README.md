# ThemePeek

ThemePeek is a simple web tool to preview color themes on a mini landing page UI.

While building projects, I often take suggestions from ChatGPT for color themes.  
I made ThemePeek to quickly visualize those color themes on a mini landing page instead of imagining them in my head.
